# Solanine Story Framework

> *NOTE: This is not the story (see story.md), however, this is meant to have the list of events that create the hero's path*
> *So essentially, this is more like a script skeleton more than a story*



## Beginning Events

- Jojo is thrust into adventure to keep his family and himself safe by fulfilling his end of this forced-upon deal.
    - If don't deliver on this deal, then the protection that's keeping himself and his sister alive will be taken away.

- Jojo follows the path his sister left to find an old village. People were barely surviving. Upon seeing Jojo's healthy body, they fall into a rage and start attacking him for any food or water they could steal to survive. 
    - Unfortunately, the water in Jojo's bottle was not retrievable and they would exhaust their energy and die if they pushed themselves too hard.
    - Thus, Jojo had to run away and not show himself to these friends and community members or else they could risk dying.

- Jojo finds the path that leads to the next floor. It is unfortunately blocked off by a boss.

- Exploring around the land, Jojo finds:
    - How to will the bottle on his back to his hands to use as a weapon
    - Caves where small bits of advice and information is stored on notes
    - A map of the first floor with 2 7-segement displays that show the player's position on the map (A1 to G7... so like a position grid)
    - A transportation system that hasn't been used in an extremely long time. (Allows for him to venture beyond where he's gone his whole life, and also travel to different places quickly)
    - A Mysterious Old Man (MOM) who tells cautions about the person Jojo has been getting the letters from, calling them 'Anokata'



## Questioning Whether Anokata is Trustworthy or Not

*After the talk with the MOM, Jojo feels uneasy about Anokata, and wants to uncover what could be happening and who Anokata is. Learning about the Solanine and its powers lead Jojo to believe that that's what Anokata is after, and the fact that a sacrifice of life must be made in order for one to get the solanine makes things even more interesting.*

*So then Jojo finds Anokata, and this idea of who Anokata is is so built up that Anokata gets no time to explain themselves. Instead, Anokata asks "Do you accept my deal?" to which Jojo draws his weapon. **THIS** is what we need to get to; to a point where the player will hate Anokata, despite all of this being a miscommunication.*



## Finding Out Exactly What Anokata Wants






## The Child Statue and the Mother Statue

*On the top of the tallest mountain in the world, a mother and child statue stand, with the child statue clasping something inside their hands. This object is glowing. Anokata stands in front of the child statue, waiting for Jojo's coming and looking hopeful for the child's treasure.*



## The Child Statue Offers and the Mother Statue Allows

*After getting Anokata defeated and locked away, The story seemingly comes to a close. Hopefully nobody else has to bear the burden of the shenanigans of Anokata. Days later, one night while Jojo is sleeping, he receives a dreams that Anokata wants him to visit the Child and Mother Statues again and to go visit his people. Jojo at first shakes this off, but decides to go anyways. There, he finds a jewel left on the ground in front of the Child Statue. Jojo picks it up, and the jewel turns from a deep black into bright red as if it were on fire, and the bright light and heat overtake Jojo's body, and the soul of Anokata is now passed onto Jojo, giving him the ability to turn into lava and protect himself from heat. This moment also fulfills the requirement of sacrificing a life, as Anokata gave their soul up for this pass on.*

- Big Cutscene when the Mother Statue allows (NOTE: you see this in the distance):
    - Since these statues are the size of Daibutsu, the Mother Statue slowly turns around 180 (no leg movmeent), and upon stopping, a loud thud is heard.
    - And then, the Mother Statue picks up their right leg, gets ready for getting into criss cross apple sauce (being still supported by their left leg), and then picks up their left leg to do criss cross apple sauce, as they slowly fall. They make it into criss cross apple sauce halfway to falling to the ground.
    - And then the whole statue thuds upon hitting the ground, and the island visibly lurches downward, unable to hold all this weight, however, after a bit, it stabilizes and returns back to its original position.


## What did the Child Statue Offer?


## Realization of the True Meaning Behind What Anokata Wants


## Break Into Anokata's Prison to Bust up the Glass Planet


## The Calling of the Lava Prophet is Passed on


## Finale (Busting the Glass Planet... What do you do now?)

*As soon as you bust the glass planet, everything starts leaving, including the clouds and the people.*

> NOTE: @TODO: who built this glass planet, and why was purifying it necessary? (NOTE that nothing is made of glass at all in this world, nothing is transparent except for water and the single glass bottle that Jojo holds.)
