## Beginning Events

- Jojo is thrust into adventure to keep his family and himself safe by fulfilling his end of this forced-upon deal.
    - If don't deliver on this deal, then the protection that's keeping himself and his sister alive will be taken away.

- Jojo follows the path his sister left to find an old village. People were barely surviving. Upon seeing Jojo's healthy body, they fall into a rage and start attacking him for any food or water they could steal to survive. 
    - Unfortunately, the water in Jojo's bottle was not retrievable and they would exhaust their energy and die if they pushed themselves too hard.
    - Thus, Jojo had to run away and not show himself to these friends and community members or else they could risk dying.

- Jojo finds the path that leads to the next floor. It is unfortunately blocked off by a boss.

- Exploring around the land, Jojo finds:
    - How to will the bottle on his back to his hands to use as a weapon
    - Caves where small bits of advice and information is stored on notes
    - A map of the first floor with 2 7-segement displays that show the player's position on the map (A1 to G7... so like a position grid)
    - A transportation system that hasn't been used in an extremely long time. (Allows for him to venture beyond where he's gone his whole life, and also travel to different places quickly)

- Jojo also finds an old man who asks if Jojo is getting pulled along by someone who's leaving notes and needs you to go up and help them.
    - That old man (T.O.M.) tells him about his experience where his family was close to dying from a landslide when one day they were all miraculously healed. Then these notes started coming out where he needed to help save the mysterious person's people or else his family's protection would end.
    - TOM, one day decided to test whether this person was actually watching, and did not perform a really small duty. This ended up with him receiving a note one day that that day's duty was not accomplished when anokata came and checked. Anokata said "I highly recommend you make sure you don't miss finishing this task again."
    - Thinking that anokata was just keeping tabs every once in awhile, TOM decided to run away with his family. Not that many days later, everybody started falling ill. They all had to return home to recover. However, the sickness never ended, and one day while TOM was trying to find more materials for his family, he returned to a note and no family.
        - The note read: "I have found another suitor. I am very sorry about your family. You are not required to perform your duties, however, I advise you do."
    - TOM does not know where the rest of his family went, but he assumes that they decided to jump off the edge.
    - To this day, TOM suffers from his illness and also grief for his family. (NOTE: the illness feels similar to being inside the landslide... the weight and inability to move)
    - TOM tells Jojo that Jojo needs to find anokata and destroy them. And make sure not to let them know anything you're planning, bc they could drive you to misery & pain the moment you do not fulfill their commands.
    > SPOILER: Anokata gave both TOM's family and Jojo's family unconditional protection, bc it's their talent and gift to heal. However, there are odd requirements in order for the people to still experience the healed state, or else they will revert to an odd half-healed state and suffer similar injuries until they fulfill these odd requirements. Anokata will simply know these requirements, and not be able to help the ppl they heal, bc they are not an omnipotent being. Consistently fulfilling these requirements (e.g. keeping the bottle attached to your back filled) is important bc reverting to the half-healed state can possibly render you unable to complete the original requirements. Anokata simply hopes that somebody will take the healing and want to say thank you by trying to help their people as well. Anokata's wording is very bad, however, but Anokata doesn't understand if the letters/wording is effective or not, bc nobody's actually answered them with helping out their people.
