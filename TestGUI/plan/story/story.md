Characters
- Jojo (Main/Playable Character)
- Jojette (Jojo sister)



### Part 1

Both Jojo and Jojette have been weak and starving in a world that had no more water. Him and his sister, Jojette, have been looking for water for ages. Jojo had been sick, and due to not being able to get up being sick and weak, his muscles have atrophied to a stage where he is simply not able to stand anymore. Thus, it's up to Jojette to look for water for her and Jojo.

This last water expedition has Jojo worrying, however. He's been waiting for more days than he's ever had to wait for ever. He's worried that his sister died and he wouldn't get any water, or worse yet, she's found and oasis and simply forgot about Jojo. Calm down. Calm down. Perhaps she's just taking awhile. Let's just wait another day, Jojo.

Footsteps sound, sluggishly treading towards the front of the door. A shadow peeks under, blocking the light that was making it thru underneath the doorway. The footsteps are slow, however. Is this Jojette? A large sigh followed by heavy, slow panting is heard outside. Slowly, almost fearful by what was on Jojo's side, the person behind the door cracks it open and the door is slowly opened until about a quarter of the way. It stops. A sigh is heard. Then suddenly, a kick flies the door open, revealing a silhouette blocking the evening sun. It's Jojette standing in the doorway, eyes wide open fearful for what she might have to see in Jojo's bed.

Jojo, realizing that it's his sister, allows his face to relax from his tense expression ready to face disappointment. Jojo gives himself a moment, then allows himself a smile his strength would allow. What a joyous moment. Water is here. Jojo was thinking he was abandoned, but now he's thinking he will get to live for some time longer.

Jojette smiles brightly and proudly turns around to grab the large canteen of water. The canteen was designed to be strapped to one's back, however, likely due to Jojette's own weakness, had opted to drag it on the ground. Jojette grabs the canteen and shows Jojo with a thumbs up how much water she was able to save for Jojo. Jojo's heart sank. The amount accumulated inside of the bottle was a mere puddle's worth. Why was there so little water in this world???

Actually, despite that little amount of water, Jojette was having a difficult time carrying the canteen that's supposed to be light. Come to think of it, has Jojette not even drank any of this water while she was trekking home? Jojo has to split the  tiny amount of water in that canteen with Jojette?? The proposition was getting more and more bleak for Jojo as he spiraled into the reality he found himself in.

A loud thud sounded, accompanied by an audible crack. Jojo's eyes shoot to the bottle. The bottle had cracked! Water had started spilling out of the bottle and Jojette was already face down on the ground drinking it all up! In a moment of fury and fear of all this precious water slipping between the cracks in the floorboard, Jojo lifts his sheets and hops out of his bed, desparate to slurp up as much of this water as he could.

How many months had it been for Jojo being in the bed, unable to leave? This question rang into Jojo's mind as he hurled himself out of his bed. Another audible crack sounds as Jojo's left side makes contact with the floor. Jojo's pain in his leg grows to near-unbearable levels. The cool water that the left side of his head managed to land into was bliss. Jojo licks the water and enjoys as much as he can in the short moment as the lion's share of the water had been claimed by the thirsty floorboards.

Jojo looks across at his sister's expression to see what she thought of his response to her selfish act. Jojette's eyes were wide, face straight towards the ground, her whole body quivering. Something was wrong. Upon realizing that that audible crack was actually Jojette, not the bottle, Jojo's heart sinks, realizing he had just taken all of the water that was meant for both of them. Almost by cue, the pain of his broken leg really starts setting in. Filled with guilt, Jojo notices a small pool of leftover water on a divet in the floorboards, so he tries lifting his arm to give Jojette some water. However, the pain is unbearable at this point. He succumbs to it and passes out.



### Part 2

Jojo wakes up on his side, facing the window that sits left of his bed. It's morning. It must have been a bad dream, Jojo. He tries rolling over to get into a position where he can prop himself up onto the headboard to sit up, but he can't. He feels sad that his muscles have atrophied to this point. With a deep breath, he tries mustering up all of his strength to roll over and sit up, and oddly enough, he is able to do it with ease. Had he always had this strength?? He yanks off the sheets and looks at the nice legs he had years ago. It was almost as if those years of the drought had never happened. Was the whole drought a lie?? No, there was no way. Jojo tests out his legs. Yes, they are real, and yes, he can stand just fine with no problems. This situation was unexpected.

His eyes catch the reflection in the mirror across the room. He walks over and sees the mirror caked with dirt and dust. Jojo takes this as proof that the drought had indeed happened. If not, the mirror would have been clean.

Wait, something is strapped to Jojo's back. Groping for it, he touches the cool glass of the bottle his sister had used for collecting water. Its crack is gone now. He tries to get it off, but it appears stuck, not even the buckle will unfasten itself...

Remembering about his sister, Jojo turns around to look for her and sees her sleeping peacefully in the bed next to Jojo's, as she should. Her face is full and she is healthy now too. Oddly, it seems as though both Jojo and Jojette are healed from the famine and drought. It is definitely obvious that the drought is definitely still happening, however.

A note sitting on the endtable catches Jojo's eye:

"Jojo, do not fear. I am protecting you and your sister. She has pushed herself to a capacity beyond her own body. Without my protection, she would have expired from her lack of strength. I am protecting her from the famine, just as I am protecting you. How have these past *3 months*<sup>1</sup> of rest been? I'm sure you feel very strong from my protection. Because I noticed you own an ancient weapon. I bound it to you to be your companion, and now you and your sister are receiving my protection with your ancient weapon as the conduit.

Now for a little deal. Jojo, seeing your sister's willpower and charity, I'm sure you are just the same. I need your cooperation to save my people. We are on the top of the highest mountain. When you get here, I will let you know what you need to do.

Of course, you don't need to accept this deal. Because of my protection that you get out of this deal, I am assuming that you accept it. Although, if you do not report to me in *338 days*<sup>1</sup>, I will assume that you are leading me on and in fact do not accept this deal, at which point I will withdraw my condition of the deal, which is my protection.

On top of this, if you or your companion fall into the void below<sup>2</sup>, I will take that cue and understand you do not want to help my people. I will take away my protection and find another who can help me.

I will continue to give protection, but the conduit, your ancient weapon, will need to be refilled or else its function as a conduit will permanently be lost and it will return to its state before I activated it; it will become just a water bottle again."

# TODO: FIND CONTRADICTIONS (NOTE: story_framework.md is MASTER TRUTH NOW)

> 1: This label will be a couple of 7-segment displays with "months" or "days" written after the number displays
>
> NOTE: about NOTE 1 (7-segment displays on the paper), the 'days' one will count down and the 'months' one will keep counting up.
> (Months will keep counting up just to show that maybe this guy just ain't too high and mighty as he puts himself to be.)

> 2: Make this "fall into the clouds below" so that you don't ever get to see what's underneath the clouds, bc you pass out
> if you fall into the clouds. So once you get the lava transformation, you *Meet the Person Behind the Letter* who has
> been picking you up and lifting you out of the clouds back to safety if you fall down. This time, you want to be made up
> of stone/lava so that they have no way of picking you up again; you can use this loophole to get past the cloud layer.
>
> NOTE: also, by this time you have figured out that the bottle is the actual supplier (not the conduit) of the "protection"
> that the guy behind the letter was so adamantly claiming he was giving you. This way you know that if you could escape the
> grasp of the guy behind the letter, you should.
>
> NOTE2: Also by this time you find that the "ancient weapon" is indeed bound to you and your sister. It chose Jojo as the companion
> because of the rest that Jojette deserves. However, bc of the two of them inheriting this "ancient weapon" thru family generations,
> its protection acts upon both of them. Also, the protection was to ward off the guy behind the letter.


> NOTE: the bottle is Jojo's companion. It cannot be separated, except if Jojo wills it to come into his hands for things
> like attacking or drawing water. As he puts his hands into position, the bottle will release itself and fly into his hands.
>
> <sub>DUBBLE</sub>NOTE: So later on, Jojo will learn to will himself to his bottle, and with this technique, he can throw the bottle
> somewhere and end up where the bottle is. The relationship with his bottle is very important.


> NOTE: about the npc's, that'd be interesting if due to their thirst for relief of the drought, upon seeing your body,
> they brandish their weapons and demand a ration of what you have that's keeping you alive. Therefore, you need to hide
> from as many villagers and friends or else they would go after you, and you'd need to kill them or run away from them.
> If you keep on fighting them for awhile, some will pass out from exhaustion or some will work themselves to death. You
> want to avoid any unnecessary deaths in this famine.
> 
> NOTE2: If there are villagers like merchants who have something so offer, they will beg for water in exchange for some
> of their services, like using something to unlock an item for you. You can steal their item if money's tight for you,
> however, they will guard it with their life. To use the tool functionally, you will need to kill them.



### Part 3

Jojo finds himself out in this weird world, and now he's healthy and strong in it. He knows he's gonna need a lot of water, especially since looking up, the tallest mountain is not even visible due to it being so high up. The underside of the floating island that it's sitting upon is the only thing visible, though it is looming high up there.

As he steps outside for the first day of his adventure, he is greeted with the first clue to get up to the top: the trail that his sister left while dragging the bottle on the ground. Let's just follow that, Jojo.

> NOTE: since the relationship of the game and the story is kinda free-form, I don't really know exactly everything that
> will happen, however this BEGINNING section is satisfactory to me for now.


#### Exploring the Land, Jojo finds:

- How to will the bottle on his back to his hands to use as a weapon
- Caves where small bits of advice and information is stored on notes
- A map of the first floor with 2 7-segement displays that show the player's position on the map (A1 to G7... so like a position grid)
- A transportation system that hasn't been used in an extremely long time. (Allows for him to venture beyond where he's gone his whole life, and also travel to different places quickly)



#### Mysterious Old Man (MOM)

- Jojo also finds a MOM who asks if Jojo is getting pulled along by someone who's leaving notes and needs you to go up and help them.
    - That MOM tells him about his experience where his family was close to dying from a landslide when one day they were all miraculously healed. Then these notes started coming out where he needed to help save the mysterious person's people or else his family's protection would end.
    - MOM, one day decided to test whether this person was actually watching, and did not perform a really small duty. This ended up with him receiving a note one day that that day's duty was not accomplished when anokata came and checked. Anokata said "I highly recommend you make sure you don't miss finishing this task again."
    - Thinking that anokata was just keeping tabs every once in awhile, MOM decided to run away with his family. Not that many days later, everybody started falling ill. They all had to return home to recover. However, the sickness never ended, and one day while MOM was trying to find more materials for his family, he returned to a note and no family.
        - The note read: "I have found another suitor. I am very sorry about your family. You are not required to perform your duties, however, I advise you do."
    - MOM does not know where the rest of his family went, but he assumes that they decided to jump off the edge.
    - To this day, MOM suffers from his illness and also grief for his family. (NOTE: the illness feels similar to being inside the landslide... the weight and inability to move)
    - MOM tells Jojo that Jojo needs to find anokata and destroy them. And make sure not to let them know anything you're planning, bc they could drive you to misery & pain the moment you do not fulfill their commands.
    > SPOILER: Anokata gave both MOM's family and Jojo's family unconditional protection, bc it's their talent and gift to heal. However, there are odd requirements in order for the people to still experience the healed state, or else they will revert to an odd half-healed state and suffer similar injuries until they fulfill these odd requirements. Anokata will simply know these requirements, and not be able to help the ppl they heal, bc they are not an omnipotent being. Consistently fulfilling these requirements (e.g. keeping the bottle attached to your back filled) is important bc reverting to the half-healed state can possibly render you unable to complete the original requirements. Anokata simply hopes that somebody will take the healing and want to say thank you by trying to help their people as well. Anokata's wording is very bad, however, but Anokata doesn't understand if the letters/wording is effective or not, bc nobody's actually answered them with helping out their people.
