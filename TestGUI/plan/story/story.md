Pre
- The land is a starving wasteland
- CharA and CharB are almost completely gone, but they try to survive
    - By finding water around the area, they're able to survive
- CharA fell ill and is in a critical condition
- CharB then became the sole person to find water for the both of them
- A long time passes and CharB is not able to find water at all
    - CharB has been spending nights outside of the home where they would normally be staying at
    - Because of this, CharA wonders if CharB is still alive
- Then one day, CharB finds water and after regaining her strength, treks all the way home to try and give CharA the water
    - Oddly, though CharB had been out for weeks, she was able to make it back to her home in less than a day
        - (A mysterious being teleported her while she was not paying attention in her trek)
