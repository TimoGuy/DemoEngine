### Part 1
Both Jojo and Jojette have been weak and starving in a world that had no more water. Him and his sister, Jojette, have been looking for water for ages. Jojo had been sick,
and due to not being able to get up being sick and weak, his muscles have atrophied to a stage where he is simply not
able to stand anymore. Thus, it's up to Jojette to look for water for her and Jojo.

This last water expedition has Jojo worrying, however. He's been waiting for more days than he's ever had to wait for ever.
He's worried that his sister died and he wouldn't get any water, or worse yet, she's found and oasis and simply forgot about Jojo.
Calm down. Calm down. Perhaps she's just taking awhile. Let's just wait another day, Jojo.

Footsteps sound, sluggishly treading towards the front of the door. A shadow peeks under, blocking the light that was making it thru underneath the doorway.
The footsteps are slow, however. Is this Jojette? A large sigh followed by heavy, slow panting is heard outside.
Slowly, almost fearful by what was on Jojo's side, the person behind the door cracks it open and the door is slowly opened
until about a quarter of the way. It stops. A sigh is heard. Then suddenly, a kick flies the door open, revealing a silhouette
blocking the evening sun. It's Jojette standing in the doorway, eyes wide open fearful for what she might have to see in Jojo's bed.

Jojo, realizing that it's his sister, allows his face to relax from his tense expression ready to face disappointment.
Jojo gives himself a moment, then allows himself a smile his strength would allow. What a joyous moment. Water is here.
Jojo was thinking he was abandoned, but now he's thinking he will get to live for some time longer.

Jojette smiles brightly and proudly turns around to grab the large canteen of water. The canteen was designed to be strapped to one's back,
however, likely due to Jojette's own weakness, had opted to drag it on the ground. Jojette grabs the canteen and shows Jojo
with a thumbs up how much water she was able to save for Jojo. Jojo's heart sank. The amount accumulated inside of the bottle was
a mere puddle's worth. Why was there so little water in this world???

Actually, despite that little amount of water, Jojette was having a difficult time carrying the canteen that's supposed to be
light. Come to think of it, has Jojette not even drank any of this water while she was trekking home? Jojo has to split the 
tiny amount of water in that canteen with Jojette?? The proposition was getting more and more bleak for Jojo as he spiraled into
the reality he found himself in.

A loud thud sounded, accompanied by an audible crack. Jojo's eyes shoot to the bottle. The bottle had cracked! Water had started
spilling out of the bottle and Jojette was already face down on the ground drinking it all up! In a moment of fury and fear of
all this precious water slipping between the cracks in the floorboard, Jojo lifts his sheets and hops out of his bed, desparate to slurp
up as much of this water as he could.

How many months had it been for Jojo being in the bed, unable to leave? This question rang into Jojo's mind as he hurled himself
out of his bed. Another audible crack sounds as Jojo's left side makes contact with the floor. Jojo's pain in his leg grows to near-unbearable
levels. The cool water that the left side of his head managed to land into was bliss. Jojo licks the water and enjoys as much as
he can in the short moment as the lion's share of the water had been claimed by the thirsty floorboards.

Jojo looks across at his sister's expression to see what she thought of his response to her selfish act. Jojette's eyes were
wide, face straight towards the ground, her whole body quivering. Something was wrong. Upon realizing that that audible crack was actually
Jojette, not the bottle, Jojo's heart sinks, realizing he had just taken all of the water that was meant for both of them. Almost by cue, the pain
of his broken leg really starts setting in. Filled with guilt, Jojo notices a small pool of leftover water on a divet in the floorboards,
so he tries lifting his arm to give Jojette some water. However, the pain is unbearable at this point. He succumbs to it and passes out.


### Part 2
Jojo wakes up on his side, facing the window that sits left of his bed. It's morning. It must have been a bad dream, Jojo.
He tries rolling over to get into a position where he can prop himself up onto the headboard to sit up, but he can't. He feels
sad that his muscles have atrophied to this point. With a deep breath, he tries mustering up all of his strength to roll over
and sit up, and oddly enough, he is able to do it with ease. Had he always had this strength?? He yanks off the sheets and
looks at the nice legs he had years ago. It was almost as if those years of the drought had never happened. Was the whole drought
a lie?? No, there was no way. Jojo tests out his legs. Yes, they are real, and yes, he can stand just fine with no problems. This situation was unexpected.

His eyes catch the reflection in the mirror across the room. He walks over and sees the mirror caked with dirt and dust.
Jojo takes this as proof that the drought had indeed happened. If not, the mirror would have been clean.

Wait, something is strapped to Jojo's back. Groping for it, he touches the cool glass of the bottle his sister had used for collecting water.
Its crack is gone now. He tries to get it off, but it appears stuck, not even the buckle will unfasten itself...

Remembering about his sister, Jojo turns around to look for her and sees her sleeping peacefully in the bed next to Jojo's, as she should.
Her face is full and she is healthy now too. Oddly, it seems as though both Jojo and Jojette are healed from the famine and drought.
It is definitely obvious that the drought is definitely still happening, however.

A note sitting on the endtable catches Jojo's eye:

"Jojo, do not fear. I am protecting you and your sister. She has pushed herself to a capacity beyond her own body. Without
my protection, she would have expired from her lack of strength. I am protecting her from the famine, just as I am protecting
you. How have these past *3 months*<sup>1</sup> of rest been? I'm sure you feel very strong from my protection.
Because I noticed you own an ancient weapon. I bound it to you to be your companion, and now you and your sister
are receiving my protection with your ancient weapon as the conduit.

Now for a little deal. Jojo, seeing your sister's willpower and charity, I'm sure you are just the same. I need your
cooperation to save my people. We are on the top of the highest mountain. When you get here, I will let you know what you need to do.

Of course, you don't need to accept this deal. Because of my protection that you get out of this deal, I am assuming that
you accept it. Although, if you do not report to me in *338 days*<sup>1</sup>, I will assume that you are leading me on
and in fact do not accept this deal, at which point I will withdraw my condition of the deal, which is my protection.

On top of this, if you or your companion fall into the void below, I will take that cue and understand you do not want
to help my people. I will take away my protection and find another who can help me.

I will continue to give protection, but the conduit, your ancient weapon, will need to be refilled or else its function
as a conduit will permanently be lost and it will return to its state before I activated it; it will become just a water
bottle again."


> 1: This label will be a couple of 7-segment displays with "months" or "days" written after the number displays
>
> NOTE: about NOTE 1 (7-segment displays on the paper), the 'days' one will count down and the 'months' one will keep counting up.
> (Months will keep counting up just to show that maybe this guy just ain't too high and mighty as he puts himself to be.)


> NOTE: the bottle is Jojo's companion. It cannot be separated, except if Jojo wills it to come into his hands for things
> like attacking or drawing water. As he puts his hands into position, the bottle will release itself and fly into his hands.
>
> <sub>DUBBLE</sub>NOTE: So later on, Jojo will learn to will himself to his bottle, and with this technique, he can throw the bottle
> somewhere and end up where the bottle is. The relationship with his bottle is very important.


> NOTE: about the npc's, that'd be interesting if due to their thirst for relief of the drought, upon seeing your body,
> they brandish their weapons and demand a ration of what you have that's keeping you alive. Therefore, you need to hide
> from as many villagers and friends or else they would go after you, and you'd need to kill them or run away from them.
> If you keep on fighting them for awhile, some will pass out from exhaustion or some will work themselves to death. You
> want to avoid any unnecessary deaths in this famine.
> 
> NOTE2: If there are villagers like merchants who have something so offer, they will beg for water in exchange for some
> of their services, like using something to unlock an item for you. You can steal their item if money's tight for you,
> however, they will guard it with their life. To use the tool functionally, you will need to kill them.
