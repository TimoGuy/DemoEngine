## Writing in the Journal (saving)

Jojo will pull out a very short pencil and his journal and write down the current date, time, and situation. This will be saving bc if Jojo faints, Anokata will save him and bring him back to the very moment in time and space where Jojo wrote in his journal. Jojo will awake right in the squatting position where he was (whichever save the player chooses to come back to).

NOTE: Jojo's face will be a little surprised, and the transfer from dead body/soul form to entering back into life should have some very cool effects.
