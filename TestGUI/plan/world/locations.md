## Starting En

### Civilization

#### Jojo's home

Jojo lives in a simple home by itself on an island, something kind of rare in his area. There are a few islands each with 2 or 3 homes on them each with differing elevations. The islands are chained together so they don't drift apart from each other.


#### The Village

During the day, nobody is out bc of the heat and direct sunlight. Unfortunately, everybody is suffering and starving, so they're trying to conserve as much energy as possible. At the nighttime, people are more likely to come out and look for water in their water catchers or anything. If Jojo encounters someone (Daytime there will be a couple people resting in the shadows waiting for water to *possibly* come. Or, Jojo could enter into someone's home and encounter them in there. Nighttime people will come outside to spend time amongst each other and look for water near the village), they will notice that he's strong and healthy and demand for his water/food, but these people are fragile. If they keep chasing Jojo for too long, they will fall from energy exhaust and expire. If Jojo hits these people just once, they will expire.

Also note: all of these villagers have names. If they expire, they're gone forever.


#### The Old Local Government Building

This is an area that contains the history of the world and why the world is the way it is currently (on the secret upper floors).

On the bottom, main floor, this building allows buying various permit-like things, like:

- Gondola ticket (you just have to fix the gondola for areas that the line is missing/broken. Also NOTE: the gondola is only in this En, or if it's in other En's, communication between them isn't that effective so the gondola ticket would have to be repurchased in different areas)


#### Receiver Port Town

This town is right next to the giant Wall that makes up the Starting En. Since the Garden En is the neighboring one, this town is in charge of transferring and distributing the food found to different villages in the Starting En.

However, due to people not showing up with food for months at this point, the people here have been worried about what's happening on the other side of the wall and have been trying to climb up it.

There is an old geezer here who knows the technique to climb up the wall, however, you need Jojo's ancient weapon to perform the maneuver (and he's really thirsty so he needs some water to get the energy to teach Jojo it).
    NOTE: Jojo also has to be able to will his weapon into his hands to be able to learn this maneuver (further down has "willing the weapon")


### Wasteland

#### Anokata's "willing the weapon" cavern

A secret skill is awaiting Jojo in this cavern. A note is given from Anokata and instructions on how to awaken your ancient weapon further.

Jojo learns how to will his weapon into his hands. With this skill activated from purifying the ancient weapon in the streams of this cavern, the weapon isn't glued to his back anymore and he can use it. The problem is is that it's extremely heavy, especially with water being in it.

#### Anokata's "willing yourself to the weapon" cavern

This is a secret skill that's a little different from "willing the weapon". Instead of willing the weapon into your hands or onto your body, you will *yourself* to the location of the weapon. Because of this skill, you're now able to throw the weapon. Essentially, you can throw the weapon super far onto an island that's unreachable, and will yourself to where the weapon is (so long as you don't drop it down into the clouds).

If you can do something like place your weapon in a catapult and have it thrown to somewhere else, the possibilities really open up.

Or if you put your weapon into a slot that passes thru a wall, you can then will yourself thru the wall.
